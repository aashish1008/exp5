# Baisc File Operations
This project is a simple Node.js web application that demonstrates basic file operations, with a user-friendly interface and a visually appealing animated GIF background. The app allows users to read from and write to a file directly through the UI. Users can enter content, save it to a file, and display the saved content on the page.
